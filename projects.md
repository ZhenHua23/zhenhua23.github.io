###  Purpose

Adaptive optics enhanced indocyanine green (AO-ICG) angiography enables high-resolution imaging of the choriocapillaris. This project introduces a feature engineering framework to quantitatively analyze microscopic changes in vascular structure in healthy vs. diseased eyes.

---

###  Methods

- **Imaging**: AO-ICG angiography with RPE-subtracted contrast
- **Subjects**: 36 participants (19 healthy, 17 diseased including AMD and genetic disorders)
- **Preprocessing**: Flow-void enhancement filtering
- **Analysis**:
  - Radially Averaged Power Spectrum (RAPS) for spatial frequency analysis
  - Extracted three interpretable features:
    - **Peak Location**: vessel spacing
    - **Peak Height**: pattern regularity
    - **Peak FWHM**: structural coherence
  - PCA and SHAP used to identify dominant features
  - Hierarchical clustering for unsupervised cohort separation

---

###  Results

- Clear visual contrast between healthy and diseased meshwork integrity
- **All three features** significantly differed between groups (p < 0.01)
- PCA and SHAP consistently ranked **peak location, FWHM, and height** as top discriminators
- **Unsupervised clustering** using only these features achieved:
  - **Accuracy: 83%**
  - **Sensitivity: 100%**

---

###  Significance

This project demonstrates that spatial frequencyâ€“based feature engineering can reveal subtle, disease-relevant changes in choriocapillaris architecture. The pipeline offers a quantitative, interpretable tool for understanding vascular degradation and holds potential for early diagnosis and disease monitoring in retinal pathologies.
