# ðŸ§ª Projects

Here is a selection of research projects:

## ðŸ”¬ AO-ICG Retinal Disease Classification
- CNN-based classification of choriocapillaris images using ResNet50, InceptionV3, etc.
- Visualized attention with Grad-CAM
- Achieved high sensitivity (>85%) on limited sample size

## ðŸ§¬ Spectral Biomarkers for Retinal Disease
- Frequency-domain analysis using FFT
- Biomarker extraction (FWHM, peak location)
- SHAP + PCA + clustering for interpretability

## ðŸ§« Tumor Phenotyping via Holography
- Biosignal processing using low-coherence holography
- Discovered metabolic phenotype subtypes
- Improved AUC for drug response prediction
