## About me
Computational physicist and AI-driven biomedical researcher with a Ph.D. in Physics and 8+ years of experience
integrating simulation, deep learning, and signal modeling to investigate structural dynamics in high-resolution biological
imaging. Specialized in modeling tissue deformation, intracellular transport, and biomechanical response using physics-
based simulation frameworks and interpretable machine learning techniques. Experienced in both hypothesis-driven
mechanobiology and data-driven phenotype discovery.
